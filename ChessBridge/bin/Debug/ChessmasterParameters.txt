Some use of InBetween when the server is an Winboard engine.
Date of file is june 24. 2001 (InBetween v. 1.3)

1. Getting the personality and magical number from Chessmaster when The King
   shall be used in other GUI.
2. Setting up The King to play with Fritz 6
3. Setting up The King to play with Chess Assistant 6
4. Correcting output from Chess Partner 5
5. Using SOS1199.exe with Fritz 6

1. Getting the personality and magical number (opk) from Chessmaster when The King
   shall be used in other GUI.

In this example it is used Chessmaster 8000 with the patch 1.0.2 added.
This will give you The King 3.12c

- Rename TheKing.exe to TheKing3.12c.exe in your CM8000 folder. After a normal
  installation the CM8000 folder will be at: C:\Program files\Chessmaster 8000\
- Copy the InBetween.exe to the CM8000 folder and rename it to TheKing.exe
- Make new text file and add the following tree lines to it:

[InBetween]
CommandLine := TheKing3.12c.exe
Debug := 3

  Save the file in your CM8000 folder with the name InBetween.ini

Now you can get the opk-value and other settings bay selecting a new game and
let a Chessmaster personality be black. Then it would popup a ‘dos-box’ where
you can extract the settings. If you only had thought of playing a game against
Chessmaster, then you could click anywhere in the Chessmaster’s window so would the
‘dos-box’ go in the background. You must not close the ‘dos-box’ because The King
is playing through this.

The meaning of some of the values Chessmaster is sending to TheKing.

Xboard  - Tells the engine to set itself in Xboard mode.
cm_parm - parameter1=value parameter2=value ...

          Some possible parameters with theirs default value. 
          
          default     ; set the engine to default.
          opp=100     ; Opponents pawn
          opn=100     ; Opponents knight
          opb=100     ; Opponents bishop
          opr=100     ; Opponents rook
          opq=100     ; Opponents queen
          opk=0       ; Opponents king
          myp=100     ; Kings pawn
          myn=100     ; Kings knight
          myb=100     ; Kings bishop
          myr=100     ; Kings rook
          myq=100     ; Kings queen
          myk=0       ; Kings king
          cc=100      ; Control of centre
          mob=100     ; Mobility
          ks=100      ; King safety
          pp=100      ; Passed pawn
          pw=100      ; Pawn weakness
          cfd=0       ; Contempt for draw
          sop=100     ; Strength of ply
          avd=0       ; Attacker/defender
          rnd=0       ; Randomness
          sel=6       ; Selective search
          md=999      ; Max search depth
          tts=1048576 ; Hash size
          ttu=1       ; Hash unit
          ana=0       ; Unknown (CM don’t use this)

          Comment:
          Max search depth (md)
          - CM set this to 99 but it don't seem to any changes to the strength

          Material/Position
          - This value is sendt by adjusting the material (opX and myX) and the
            positional values (cc, mob, ks, pp and pw).

          Hash settings (tts and ttu)
          - When hash=0      tts=4096,     ttu=0
          - When hash=512Kb  tts=524288,   ttu=1
          - When hash=1Mb    tts=1048576,  ttu=2
          - When hash=2Mb    tts=2097152,  ttu=3
          - When hash=4Mb    tts=4194304,  ttu=4
          - When hash=8Mb    tts=8388608,  ttu=5
          - When hash=16Mb   tts=16777216, ttu=6
          - When hash=32Mb   tts=33554432, ttu=7
          - When hash=64Mb   tts=67108864, ttu=8

          Kings king (myk)
          - These seem to not have anything to do with the strength of King’s play
            but are still changing between 0 and 100000. It could be that this is a
            seed value for the random function inside King, so that mister Koning have
            a method to freeze this when debugging.

          Opponent king (opk)
          - Magic number. Must be set to correct value for King to play decent.
            The value will changes with the clock and with reboot of the machine.

          Summary of command:
            Xboard, new, quit, random, force, white, black, level, st, sd, time,
            otime, cm_solve, go~anal, go, go~auto, go~anti, ?, draw, result,
            edit, setboard, hint, bk, undo, remove, hard, easy, post, nopost,
            analyze, exit, ., lt, cm_parm

Possible trouble
  The King is sending ply count in analyze line on the format 3001 etc.
  When castle is in the pv it uses zero (0) instead of capital O.

If you are using Chessmaster 9000 instead, do the same as above except that you should replace the last 5 parameters with

My Centre Control (mycc)=cm_parm mycc=%i|spin|100|0|600 
My Mobility (mymob)=cm_parm mymob=%i|spin|100|0|600 
My King Safety (myks)=cm_parm myks=%i|spin|100|0|600 
My Passed Pawn (mypp)=cm_parm mypp=%i|spin|100|0|600 
My Pawn Weakness (mypw)=cm_parm mypw=%i|spin|100|0|600 
Opponent's Centre Control (opcc)=cm_parm opcc=%i|spin|100|0|600 
Opponent's Mobility (opmob)=cm_parm opmob=%i|spin|100|0|600 
Opponent's King Safety (opks)=cm_parm opks=%i|spin|100|0|600 
Opponent's Passed Pawn (oppp)=cm_parm oppp=%i|spin|100|0|600 
Opponent's Weakness (oppw)=cm_parm oppw=%i|spin|100|0|600 
Also, the selective search values can now be increased to up to 16 as compared to a maximum of 12 in Chessmaster 8000. The default Selective search is 9 as mentioned before so the line for selective search should read
Selective Search (sel)=cm_parm sel=%i|spin|9|0|16

Remember to alter the line below options that says Program=TheKing3.12d.exe to the path where The King engine lies.For example Program=c:\chessmaster8000\Theking.exe
Replace InitString=cm_parm default\ncm_parm opk= xxx with the OPK string obtained in step 1.

2. Setting up The King to play with Fritz 6

The engines folder for Fritz is after a normal installation located at:
                C:\Program files\Chessbase\Engines

See P.1 for finding the magical number.

 - Download the Winboard adapter from Chessbase’s web site and put it in the
   engine folder for Fritz, and rename it to TheKing.eng
 - Make a new sub-folder in the engines folder and give it the name TheKing.
 - Copy InBetween.exe to this new folder and rename it to TheKing.exe
 - Make a new text file and add the following text to it:

[Parameter]
CommandLine =
Author = Johan de Koning
Engine = The King 3.12c
Debug = False
LogFile = False

[Support]
AnalyzeMode = True
PonderMode = False
CastleAndEP = False
EvaluationWhite = False

   Save the file in TheKing sub folder and give it the name TheKing.init

 - Make new text file and add the following lines to it:

[InBetween]
; Change this path to point to your copy of The King
CommandLine := C:\Program files\Chessmaster 8000\TheKing3.12c.exe

[Client2Server]
xboard := xboard\nhard\neasy\n\npost\nnew\ncm_parm default\ncm_parm opk=?
fritz :=
reset :=

[Server2Client]
; This stat01: message could stop the analysis if it recognize something 
; wrong in the line, and it will be something wrong in this line because
; the translation of the ply would work on the stat01 line too.
stat01: := why should I
; Translation of ply. The king is sending plies as number like 3001 where
; the real ply is 3, 001 could maybe be some sort of extension to the search.
; If you have enough time you could change the following lines to what the
; king really sends instead of this shortcut I do with simply masking out
; this extension part. 
001 :=
002 :=
003 :=
004 :=
005 :=
006 :=
007 :=
008 :=
009 :=
010 :=
011 :=
012 :=
013 :=
014 :=
015 :=
016 :=
017 :=
018 :=
019 :=
020 :=

   Save the file in your TheKing sub-folder with the name InBetween.ini


3. Setting up The King to play with Chess Assistant 6

See P.1 for finding the magical number.

 - Copy InBetween.exe to the CA6 folder.

 - Add InBetween as a Winboard engine and name it TheKing in Engine setup
 - Take the Engines6.ini file in the CA6 folder up in a texteditor (notepad)
   and add the following two lines:

[TheKing]
SetBoard=true 

 - Make new text file and add the following lines to it:

[InBetween]
; Change this path to point to your copy of The King
CommandLine := c:\Program files\Chessmaster 8000\TheKing3.12c.exe

[Client2Server]
; Setting up The King with 16Mb hash
xboard := xboard\npost\nnew\ncm_parm default\ncm_parm tts=16777216 ttu=6 opk=???? 

[Server2Client]
; CA6 won’t have a plus sign in analysis
+ := 
; When you see a ply number above 1000 in the engine window you could put it in
; here for showing the correct ply number. Format: 3001 := 3 This is mostly of
; cosmetic art.

   Save the file in your CA6 folder with the name InBetween.ini



4. Correcting output from Chess Partner 5

 - Copy the InBetween.exe to the folder where you have the engine.
 - Edit the EnginePath in the section for the engine in engineext.ini and set in:

EnginePath="C:\myengine\InBetween.exe myengine.exe"

 - Make new text file and add the following lines to it:

[Client2Server]
Q := q
R := r
B := b
N := n

   Save the file in your engine folder with the name InBetween.ini


5. Using SOS1199.exe with Fritz 6
 
  The engines folder for Fritz is after a normal installation located at:
                C:\Program files\Chessbase\Engines

 - Download the Winboard adapter from Chessbase’s web site and put it in the
   engine folder for Fritz, and rename it to sos.eng
 - Make a new sub-folder in the engines folder and give it the name sos.
 - Copy the Sos.exe file (11/99) to this new folder and rename it to sos1199.exe
 - Copy InBetween.exe to this new folder and rename it to sos.exe
 - Make a new text file and add the following text to it:

[Parameter]
CommandLine =
Author= Rudolf Huber
Engine= SOS 11.99
Debug = False
LogFile = False

[Support]
AnalyzeMode = False
PonderMode = False
CastleAndEP = False
EvaluationWhite = False

   Save the file in sos sub folder and give it the name sos.init

 - Make new text file and add the following lines to it:

[InBetween]
CommandLine := sos1199.exe
Priority := low

[Client2Server]
xboard := xboard\nnew\nlevel 0 5 0
fritz := 
reset :=

   Save the file in your sos sub-folder with the name InBetween.ini
